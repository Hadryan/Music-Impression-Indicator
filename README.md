It classifies user favorite songs, tracking audio pitch and extract some features as min/max/avg signal frequency(Hz) based on confidence rate, WPM(soon). Based on the classification, it determines likenesses, supports all formats that FFMPEG supports. using Python, TensorFlow, CREPE, Multi-threading
